\v 4 I saw thrones on which people were sitting. God gave them authority to judge. I also saw the souls of other people whose heads had been cut off because they had spoken the truth about Jesus and declared God's message. They were people who had refused to worship the beast or its image, and who did not allow the beast's servants to put the beast's mark on them, either on their foreheads or on their hands. They became alive again, and they ruled with Christ during those one thousand years.

\p
\v 4 Then I saw thrones. Seated on them were those given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image, and they refused to receive the mark on their forehead or hand. They came to life, and they reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
